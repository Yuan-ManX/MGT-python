# MGT-python

The Musical Gestures Toolbox for Python is a collection of tools for video visualization and video analysis.

## About

Videos can be used to develop new visualisations to be used for analysis. The aim of creating such alternate displays from video recordings is to uncover features, structures and similarities within the material itself, and in relation to, for example, score material. Three useful visualisation techniques here are motion images, motion history images and motiongrams.

MGT can generate both dynamic and static visualizations, as well as some quantitative data:

- dynamic visualisations (video files)
    - motion videos
    - motion history videos
- static visualisations (images)
    - motion average images
    - motiongrams
    - videograms
- motion data (csv files)
    - quantity of motion
    - centroid of motion
    - area of motion


## Installation


### Windows, macOS and Linux

Standard installation via pip: paste and execute the following code in the Terminal (macOS, Linux) or the PowerShell (Windows):

`pip install mgmodule`

## Usage

The documentation folder in this repository holds the main documentation file [MGT-doc.pdf](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python/blob/master/documentation/MGT_doc.pdf), which describes all functionalities.

The Jupyter notebook [MotionGesturesToolbox.ipynb](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python/blob/master/MotionGesturesToolbox.ipynb) shows examples of the usage of the toolbox.

## History

This toolbox builds on the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-matlab/), which again builds on the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Max](http://www.uio.no/english/research/groups/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/).

The software is currently maintained by the [fourMs lab](https://github.com/fourMs) at [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/) at the University of Oslo.
