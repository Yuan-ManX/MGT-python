# MGT-python
Musical Gestures Toolbox for Python

This toolbox is a port and further development of the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT).

# About
Videos can be used to develop new visualisations to be used for analysis. The aim of creating such alternate displays from video recordings is to uncover features, structures and similarities within the material itself, and in relation to, for example, score material. Three useful visualisation techniques here are motion images, motion history images and motiongrams.

MGT can generate both dynamic and static visualizations, as well as some quantitative data:

- dynamic visualisations (video files)
- motion video
- motion history video
- static visualisations (images)
- motion average image
- motiongrams
- videograms
- motion data (csv files)
- quantity of motion
- centroid of motion
- area of motion

# Installation

# Usage
In this repository is documentation file "MGT-doc.pdf" which describes all functionalities, and a Jupyter notebook "MotionGesturesToolbox.ipynb" with examples of usage.
